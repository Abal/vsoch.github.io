<p style="padding-top:40px;">I am a <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/vanessa-sochat" target="_blank">Research Software Engineer</a> for <a href="https://srcc.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Research Computing</a> and the <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford School of Medicine</a>. I specialize in system engineering, infrastructure development, and image processing for computational analyses and workflows. I am the primary developer at Stanford for <a href="https://singularityware.github.io" target="_blank">Singularity</a>, a driver to bring <a href="https://researchapps.github.io/" target="_blank">Research Applications</a> support to Stanford, and lead developer of <a href="https://www.singularity-hub.org" target="_blank">Singularity Hub</a>, and <a href="https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry" target="_blank">Singularity Registry</a> both frameworks optimized for deployment of container-based workflows and "science as a service" capabilities.</p>

<p>As a graduate student my work spanned computer science, medicine, and imaging. I was a proud member of the <a href="http://poldracklab.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Poldrack Lab</a> at Stanford. Our work spanned neuro-informatics, cognitive neuroscience, and reproducibility. I was introduced to the domain of neuroimaging as an RA in the <a href="http://www.haririlab.com" target="_blank">Laboratory of Neurogenetics</a> at Duke University working under Ahmad Hariri.</p>

<p style="line-height:26px">The qualities of experience that are most fulfilling to me are making things work, organizing and understanding new processes, and creating efficiency and beauty in design. I love learning, programming and debugging, and I have vision for how I want the future to be. I am adamant about pursuing the things that make me happy, today and now. A successful life means confidence in a future vision and happiness in the present.</p>

<p>While this is primarily a personal site, most of my life can be found on <a href="http://www.github.com/vsoch" target="_blank">[github]</a>, and a general list of work under <a href="/work">[portfolio]</a>. During graduate school I maintained a space for exploration of methods and dataÂ <a href="http://www.vbmis.com/learn" target="_blank">[1]</a>, as well as pre-graduate school documentation and work <a href="http://www.vsoch.com/wiki" target="_blank">[2]</a>. Contact information and is available upon request.</p>
