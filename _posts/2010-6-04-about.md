My passion lies in creating tools and methods to better study the human brain, and my core interests tend to be focused around reproducibility, web-based visualization, high performance computing, and cloud-based tools. My graduate work spans computer science, medicine, and imaging, with the ultimate goal of building useful tools and algorithms to empower neuroimaging scientists.

As a graduate student I am a proud member of the [Poldrack Lab](http://poldracklab.stanford.edu) here at Stanford. Our work spans neuro-informatics, cognitive neuroscience, and reproducibility. We are awesome! I was introduced to the domain of neuroimaging as an RA in the [Laboratory of Neurogenetics](http://www.haririlab.com) at Duke University working under Ahmad Hariri. We utilized functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), as well as behavioral and genetic data to study how variability in neural circuitry can lead to individual differences in behavior, and how these differences in brain function can further be connected to an individual’s genes. I am forever grateful to Ahmad for introducing me to the work that I’ve come to love.

The qualities of experience that are most fulfilling to me are making things work, organizing and understanding new processes, and creating efficiency and beauty in design. I love learning, coding and debugging, and all parts of research. I am adamant about pursuing the things that make me happy, today and now. A successful life means confidence in a future vision and happiness in the present.

While this is primarily a personal site, I maintain separate spaces for current exploration of methods and data [[1]](http://www.vbmis.com/learn), and pre-graduate school documentation and work [[2]](http://www.vsoch.com/wiki), and most of my life can be found on [[github]](http://www.github.com/vsoch), and what I do for fun [[portfolio]](http://vsoch.com/blog/sites).  Contact information and CV is available upon request.
