It was then under a brave full moon  
 I knew that blue love had come too soon  
 Counting and pebbles blessed to know  
 So many entrances desperate to go

Cradle and gypsy  
 Maverick and muse  
 Laughter and lady  
 Tally and twos

A mantric obsession, a primal duress  
 Fevered delinquence traced your caress  
 A melody greatly, jittered with skin  
 A purposed hatred, a remnant by sin

Spider and coral  
 Cluster and clear  
 Senseless and moral  
 Vanished and dear

I felt it crush as you moved away  
 A virtue so lush, a potions dismay  
 A dim rimmed lesson bestow my heart  
 A million mirages splayed apart
