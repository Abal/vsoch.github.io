Decrepit sensling sworn in satin  
 Riddled heartbeat dancing Latin  
 Partial posies one less more  
 Chanting roses, forevermore

Prancing pickney draw your dress  
 Withhold these embers my caresss  
 Spice it lovely thoughtful, clear  
 Paint it vemish, paint it dear

Flattering follies, cluttered rust  
 Barely breaking wayward trust  
 Pinky nail princess, brightly adorned  
 Unbreakable story, lest be scorned

One two tree return to class  
 Puckered pencils, hasty lass  
 Velvet curtain, wisps of dream  
 Brushing closed, slowing stream

Miraging vision dance from hear  
 Until tomorrow, my vibrant dear!
