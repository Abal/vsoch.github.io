Here is a list of tuples (for python) for all the video extensions (types[x][0]), the descriptor (types[x][1]), and the commonality (types[x][2]). This was harder to put together than it should have been, and I want to put it here for future reference, because I never want to make it again!

code

Here would be an example of how to get a short list, for example looking up all the extensions that are very common:

code

I simply printed them all in a straight line, however you could format them in whatever way you like, or put them into another data structure for better use! I would also suspect that .ogg and .ogv will increase in popularity with HTML5, and will soon belong to the “Very Common” group!
