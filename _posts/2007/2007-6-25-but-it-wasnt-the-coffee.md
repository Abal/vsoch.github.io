I had an epiphany today after an intellectual conversation with two economists in my group in a coffee shop on State Street.

I’m different, and that”s OK.

It makes life harder sometimes; it makes me feel lonely sometimes, but it makes me intriguing, it makes me beautiful. You may never be able to figure me out, but I bet you that knowing me will add value to your life.

I may always run alone, and give a lot more energy than I’ll ever receive back, but I do it because once you strip away everything that keeps us occupied during the day, giving this energy to you, and those who I love, is what gives my life meaning.
