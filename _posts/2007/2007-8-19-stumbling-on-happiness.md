I apologize for the time away: I was busy with another blog, but I have returned.

Here are some interesting ideas from the latest book I am reading, “Stumbling on Happiness” I expect to have a lot to say about this book in the next few days, but I’ve really just started.

*“The things we do when we expect our lives to continue are naturally and properly different than things we do when we expect our lives to end.”*

This says a lot for adversity breeding wisdom. Until you are forced to realize what is important, you really don’t have perspective, and with this realization, incentives change, people change.

*“We spend most of the hours of today constructing tomorrows that might make our future selves happy.”*

and I think that there is a fundamental difference between fulfillment and happiness, but I haven’t figured it out yet.
