So I don’t have any doubts about being able to complete most of a marathon at this point. Padr sure was surprised when he found me chillin’ in the ER an hour before his shift got out last night.

Padr: “Vaness!!”

Me: “Padrrrrrr!!”

*hug*

Padr: What a treat! But how did you get here?”

Me: Whatever you’re thinking, you’re probably right.

Padr: Oh my God, to Manchester? Don’t even tell me…

*smirk*
