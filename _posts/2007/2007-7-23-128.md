Here is Thursday’s run:

I’m drooling already… Newton is so gorgeous, and I love riding the far branches of the T! (It gets crowded as you move in :P)

here was today’s run… I wound up missing the loop turn and going a bit farther than expected… it was a tempo so it was short, fast, and sweet, about 4 miles.

and the ACTUAL run (doh! wrong turn… who has two roads going off of the same street with the same name anyway?!) Believe it or not, the second one is about a mile longer…

and Thursday I’ll either go long in the morning or *someone* might just run with me from work to the intern get together… werd!
