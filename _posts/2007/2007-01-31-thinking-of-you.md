I thought I saw your face in a milky concauction.
Never had missed, or longed for a voice, never had kissed, 
or felt passion in a single touch: 

A gentle snow that holds its breath for the soft crunch of a footstep. <br>
A heart stained with happiness, and painted in your image.<br>
A soul floating in a garden, tending the passion that emit these eyes.<br>

Forget the world, my meaning is in your face. My hunger for life grows in your embrace.

I thought I saw your face in a milky concauction.<br>
but it was just a reflection in tea, and nothing more<br>
