Hey old Spanish buddies!

I just put [Cita Ciega]( http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=88DD80C1C19F4521) up… MAN was that a long video… it took 5 uploads total! You guys are great for dealing with me and my ridiculously long script ![:)](http://vsoch.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png) Anyhoo here it is…

Let me know if anything doesn’t work or play right. I still think the funniest parts are the tennis scene for the first date with the pregnant lady with me and Vasta, Vasta as Pequeno Yo with Victoria, and Yin y Yoo at the end.

OH and the commercials are great too hehe.

Hope you guys are doing well! I miss our Spanish antics… keep in touch!
