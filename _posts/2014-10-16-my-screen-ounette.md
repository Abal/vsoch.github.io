You got away from me, my screen-ounette!  
 A careful melody of consistent characters  
 A little puddle of pretty print  
 A trailing list of timid text  
 And then frozen.

I didn’t know what to do, my screen-ounette!  
 Like a frozen flash of green fury!  
 Like a ridiculous racing of red!  
 Like an arbitrage of ardent artichokes!  
 The sharpness bit.

WHY is the word “Attached” filling your status space?!

“screen -r” …  
 Lord, mercy, please! respond to my copy paste!

code

And we are together again, screen-ounette!!!  
 And my happiness quota is again well set ![:)](http://vsoch.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png)
