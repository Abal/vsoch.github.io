Now since 17 days has come to bear,  
 let me tell you about this ingrown hair.  
 Upon first introduction, when all was new to me  
 he was introduced as my new friend JP.  
 Between him and I it is hard to tell  
 But on this distinction, I’ve come to dwell.  
 He emerges from a labyrinth that I cannot see  
 intermixing and twisty, elaborate like a tree  
 Unassuming but strange, he pokes out of his hole  
 Not to be mistaken for freckle or mole.  
 From the outside glance I would never know  
 where this JP does boldly go.  
 Submerging from the surface, behind my ear  
 wrapping through the cheek, blue and clear.  
 He then dives down, running out of space  
 into the depths of that soft necky place.  
 Where he ends I have yet to feel  
 His girth and length, I’m going to reel.  
 He was supposed to leave after 7 days time  
 but he refused, his home far too sublime.  
 And after this time had come to pass  
 JP has a little bit of attitude, of sass.  
 He drools more on the pillow than I’ve ever done  
 He can’t talk much in public, so he leaks a ton.  
 He spits out presents of things I can’t ID  
 So many gifts, without a charge or fee!  
 His fashion sense, questionable at best,  
 a white mumu to complement my black vest.  
 I have often wished to yank out this fool,  
 I could sure do without following his rule.  
 But reminded am I, the reason he is here  
 Is to give me care, in a time of fear.  
 And so he continues, a batman in a private lair  
 the diabolical, the most ultimate, ingrown hair.
