I usually write this little “last night” note on a small piece of colored paper, but thought I’d go for a digital version this year.

Not a lot to say, I’m learning so much, surrounded by humbling, interesting, and passionate people, and I feel empowered with my many flavors of independence and responsibility. I’m confident in my present and future self and goals, which is probably the ultimate challenge for someone my age. The things that I am doing, learning, screwing up, getting right, discovering, are just awesome, and the year to come is sure to be an exciting one. 22? Werd! 23? Here we come!
