In three days I will graduate, and in three days I will probably be seeing a lot of people for the last time, at least as familiar friends‚Ä¶ because the next time will most likely be for a quick moment at some future reunion, and it won‚Äôt really be the same. That is the nature of life. In that mindset, I‚Äôd like to say some final things. I ‚Äòm a lot more articulate with key than with word, making this note my expression of choice. Here goes.

My time here has ended wonderfully, been challenging at times, and I am most grateful for the things that I have learned about myself, and the questions that this environment elicited in me that might still need answers. I came here as a sophomore knowing absolutely no one, a large feat given the size and plastic-wrapped nature of this institution. I‚Äôve many a times said that, in retrospect, I would not have transferred, and from an academic standpoint and examination of the large social structure, perhaps this is true. But when I zoom in to the people that I have come to care about here, I am certain that coming here has only broadened and enlivened my life.

I am grateful for the people that have made my experience very rich, the professors that have challenged me, and the few that were there for me during some of the harder times. My early to bed ‚Äì early to rise and tendency to be introverted make me a more challenging friend to keep, and I am so grateful to you guys that consistently poked me to keep the connection strong.

To all of my friends: When I think back to my time at Duke, I‚Äôm going to remember Sitar Sundays, Crowell being the best and baddest dorm with a pimp RA crew, the many times I wrinkled my nose or teared from laughing so hard, baking like a wild woman at Smart Home, and all seemingly insignificant number of times that we ate out and bonded over chicken, awkward waiters, and discussion about‚Ä¶ oh you know üòõ

Memories are of a nature that they don‚Äôt store in complete sentences or images, so that is how I will share them, in a mental burp, one thing leading to the next. I‚Äôll probably add to this as I think of good memories, but here is a start.

1) TWINS!!! First gergz and BG, and now Ravi and Jayson backpack twins.  
 2) The Grants‚Ä¶ potench. potench.  
 3) Ravi‚Äôs sweet-ass car‚Ä¶ (or might I say, sweet ass-car, hehe), many walks to and from the Blue Zone, somehow getting 4 people across the backseat and to the destination like cozy sardines.  
 4) Gergz magoo and his love of shredded wheat. 2nd dinner, 3rd dinner, you know.. shooshoopeedoo!  
 5) Bryan and Gergz monopolizing the name game with characters from Bleach‚Ä¶ yeaaah!  
 6) How everyone always got rotisserie chicken with two sides, and Greg scammed them to get an extra one, and I never could do it.  
 7) Rhut‚Äôs awesomely dry and direct sense of humor, and thanks for giving me proper instructions about crossing my legs when I‚Äôm wearing a dress, hehe.  
 8) Bryan flexing at the most unexpected, and completely funny times with appropriate facial expressions  
 9) Andy, Lo Lo!

 18) Link! Ravi, the few times that I went to the link to join you studying. It was a push for me, because libraries are frightening, but I got to see your determination and work ethic.

And thank you for always giving me a call to grab dinner, and pushing me to leave my little introverted shell to have some amazing experience I wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise had!

 29) Bryan‚Äôs big stomach, and that turd waiter that stole my dinner. Z, thanks for standing up for me!
