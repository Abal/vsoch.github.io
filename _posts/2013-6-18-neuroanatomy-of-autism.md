### sMRI

- Pathological / abnormal regions in ASD: frontal lobes, amygdala and cerebellum
- time course of brain development, not final product, is most disturbed in autism (so age is a salient factor, and we would want to assess if similar age = more similar brain)
- Kanner's asd features include: - impairments in reciprocal social interactions
- abnormal development and use of language
- repetitive and ritualized behaviors and a narrow range of interests

 

### Behavior --> Regional Structural/ Functional Abnormality

These findings in the literature pertain to regional aberrancies associated with different behavioral types.  I would want to validate these associations in my work, or use them to quasi-validate my approach.  Broadly, these regions include the frontal lobe, the superior temporal cortex, the parietal cortex and the amygdala.

#### Language Function

- Expressive language function: Broca’s area in the inferior frontal gyrus and portions of supplementary motor cortex
- Receptive language function: Wernicke's area,
- Superior temporal sulcus (language processing and social attention)

#### Repetitive and Stereotyped Behaviors

- share many similarities with abnormal actions of OCD
- regions include orbitofrontal cortex, caudate nucleus
- evidence for enlargement of the caudate nucleus: correlated with the presence of repetitive and ritualistic behaviors in adolescents and young adults?

#### Amygdala

- boys with autism: appears to undergo an abnormal developmental time course (precocious enlargement that persists through late childhood)
- 13%–16% abnormal enlargement of the amygdala in young children with autism (36–56 months of age)
- amygdala enlargement is associated with more severe anxiety and worse social and communication skills
- neurons in certain nuclei appear unusually small and more densely packed than in healthy control

#### Epilepsy (highly comorbid with OCD)

- associated with pathology of cerebral cortex, amygdala, cerebellum, hippocampal formation

#### Brain Size

- young children with autism (18 months to 4 years) have a 5%–10% abnormal enlargement in total brain volume, not clear if persists into adulthood
- Herbert et al. postulated that abnormal brain enlargement in children with ASD is disproportionally accounted for by increased white matter, not gray matter, although gray matter is also increased too

### 

### DTI

- Reductions in FA in cerebral white matter, consistent reductions reported in and near the genu of the corpus callosum
- DTI and volumetric study of the corpus callosum found a 14% reduction in corpus callosum size was associated with reduced FA in the genu and splenium
- Most consistent increases in gray and white matter have been reported in the frontal lobes, but there is no consistent pattern

### An informatics opportunity!

> "A perusal of this literature emphasizes the need for the field of developmental neuropathology to establish a systematic approach to evaluating abnormal brain development"

### 

### Morphometry

- Abnormalities in cortical shape: sylvian fissure, superior temporal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus
- cortical thickness, increased over the entire cerebral cortex, most prominent in parietal and temporal regions
- (postmortem) findings: irregular laminar patterns, esp anterior cingulate cortex, increased cortical thickness, high neuronal density, neurons preset in the molecular layer
- abnormalities within the hippocampus, both in volume and shape

*Why would neurons be in the molecular layer? or increased neurons in white matter?*

### 

### Microstructure of Cortex

- Cortical layer III: reduced intercolumnar width of the minicolumns in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or Brodmann’s area (BA) 9
- 79% post-mortem studies show decreased density of Purkinje cells, particularly in the hemispheres, but these subjects also had comorbid seizure disorders, those medications are known to kill these cells
- no postmortem evidence for abnormalities in the thalamus, basal ganglia

It would be worth looking up or assessing if there is abnormal (functional) connectivity with thalamus
