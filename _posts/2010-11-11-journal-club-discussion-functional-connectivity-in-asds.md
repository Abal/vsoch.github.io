I gave my first presentation in about three years to present a paper for Journal Club. It by no means was perfect (and I apologize to Dr. Cohen for calling him “Sasha” instead of “Simon”), but it was a lot of fun! What I learned is that there is a lot of value in just presenting or talking about a paper with a group of people, as each person brings an individual knowledge set, questions, and opinions. It can lead to ideas for new research, and a better understanding of the discussed paper than is obtained from reading the paper in isolation.
