Pale these shoulders rest in flight  
 Dark the sunlight kiss the night  
 Lank and dorsal seething rank  
 Until the mudhour mishap dank

All lop-sed brilliance and cankerous touch  
 Midnight shanty revealed as such  
 Pipsqueak trembles and yellow page  
 Hopping buttress and lilac sage

Gone these creed runs far from site  
 Dust en-sequent dares delight
