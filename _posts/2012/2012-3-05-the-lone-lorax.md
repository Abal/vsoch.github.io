when drips a little puddle  
 escaped from cocoa spoon  
 he sees inside the muddle  
 the lorax in his room  
 behind the wall a pip  
 and dance a veiny maze  
 this reflection that he sips  
 this awkward, curly gaze  
 a laugh so shrill,  
 a voice so near  
 a tummy far away  
 a love to nill  
 a sense of fear  
 a heart that does dismay  
 dry up the puddle might  
 and he will wipe away  
 his hopes and dainty fright  
 for maybe one more day  
 for deep down he knows  
 that lorax come undone  
 for deep conviction he goes  
 the safest route as one
