so sharp was the edge of that flesh,<br>
a deep burgandy stained with fermentation<br>
such rush was the pound in my chest<br>
hesitant, and filled with trepidation.<br>
 
My eyes upon you I started at your base<br>
a thick, and dense, hefty structure<br>
yet somehow it is formidable as a case<br>
without gash, fall, or subtle rupture<br>
 
I squint glancing upward to your core<br>
protecting my sight from your bold regality<br>
to such a body, many women have adored,<br>
and so many men have reached their fatality<br>
 
To such a force I will not look,<br>
my eyes skip a blink to move up faster<br>
Feet cold, hair estatic, fingers shook,<br>
of a pungent, earthy spell, you are the castor.<br>
 
To fast forward time, I rush to your face<br>
hoping to catch a fleeting mercy in your eye<br>
unbelievable how man has formed you in haste<br>
Not a hint of candid, breath, or shy.<br>
 
Human kind has, and will never conquer you.<br>
Fleshy, putrid, skeething, and filled with lies!<br>
yet every year, you engage us, your creator, in this battle anew.<br>
you, sticky, you malevolent, you unapologetically evil... pumpkin pie!<br>
