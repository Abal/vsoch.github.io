VIDEOS TO MAKE  
 overview of website  
 talk about data universe, finding data, steps for organization with matlab  
 introduce to matlab, period  
 talk about what a “processing pipeline” usually looks like (big picture)  
 intro to neuroimaging files, data types, etc  
 video about ROI/mask/tools  
 ICA applied to neuroimaging  
 basic signal analysis  
 Kullback-Leibler Divergence  
 Bregman Divergence  
 ICA AND PCA  
 ICA analysis (overview)  
 GLM analysis (beta maps?)  
 Normalization  
 spatial entropy  
 clustering degree  
 Infomax Algorithm (ICA, gift toolbox)  
 PCA-R CCICA by Sui et al 2009 for methods  
 Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence  
 VANESSA look up MSD by Varoquaux  
 Hurst exponent  
 Wavelet Leader Based Multifractal formalism (WLMF) Analysis: measures a collection of scaling exponents - gives description of scale invariance aka "multifracticality"  
 Multisubject Dictionary Learning (MSDL) algorithm: produces a set of spatial components that appear more sparse than ICA counterpart  
 Dictionary learning tehcniques (look up Varoquaux 2010b)- procedure extracts a group level atlas of spatial signatures of the processes observe a well as corresponding subject level maps  
 For a recent review about the pros and cons of the SCA and ICA approaches to RNS extraction, see Cole et al 2010  
 PCA - ICA = just residuals?  
 Power Spectral Density (PSD)  
 Univariate: Seed based linear Correlation Analysis (SCA)  
 Multivariate (ICA)  
 RSN (resting state network) extraction achieved by thresholding the correlation matrix - correlations between voxel values, so we just see the highest ones?  
 SCALE INVARIANCE: Shown that brain activity, regardless of imaging technique, is always arrhythmic and shows a scaling, or scale-free time dynamics which implies that no time scale plays a predominant or a specific role.  
 associated with long range correlation in time.  
 BRAIN NETWORKS (overview of each one)  
 MAP estimate (email Franman)  
 How to use Fisher's Test for Feature Selection
