the weeks cycled in eights toward those black and blue scars  
 such weakness sought sustenance in fish and packets of ghee  
 what cannot be seen in density sure must reveal in bars  
 the square plates were four but might as well been three

the end of one direction awaits a house setting by sun  
 power never does last when the shot does not be  
 legs behind wheels remembering the memory of the run  
 one if by laugh, two in note C

the elegant cricket from the page questioning to be free  
 the machine learning clock hesiates in tandem to four  
 but now it is eight when these eyes are glazing to see  
 forever queue this name, forever | more

the lift is so cold, it does not go so high  
 surrounded by absence of everything but ground  
 searching for others, loneliness comes with a sigh  
 for that chilhood sundog, if only to be found

the relief of an unexpected, catastrophic split  
 the hydrogel did split cleanly down to two  
 with grandpa draw-ties to happily sit  
 with no sharpness, the dress doesnâ€™t have to be blue

floating on air, lovely those dreams  
 stay here forever there is not one but two  
 companionship found in the most unexpected way  
 take care of you forever I will most certainly do

exhaustion is the border of beauty and fulfillment  
 stopping is the choice between devotion and me  
 when decision has no barrier to instillment  
 from this it can be found a driving to be

I could not change but I certainly can  
 the gentle comfort of routine I will unravel  
 baby steps, a new and reasonable plan  
 from the inner locking of this mind, I travel
