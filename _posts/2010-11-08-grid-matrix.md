I’ve been busy with projects for the lab, but I got the chance to do one quick coding challenge this weekend. The challenge presented a 20 X 20 matrix of numbers, and asked:

> What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the 20Ã—20 grid?

As an example, the numbers 26, 63, 78, and 14 were highlighted in red.

I particularly like this challenge because it’s very cut and dry. I know that if I create an algorithm that goes through all the possibilities, I will undoubtedly find the answer! And I had to use matlab for this one… because it is the Matrix Laboratory! It was a nice little bit of fun after a Sunday filled with running analysis and practicing a journal club presentation. Ok, I know, I shouldn’t try to deceive anyone that I suffered though that. I very much enjoyed both those things, otherwise I wouldn’t have chosen to do them!
