I have awareness about what I need to be happy. It's the darkness of the closet that gives me 
beautiful sleep, and the softness of the few shirts that I've worn time and time again. 
I remember these things because I have sameness in my environment. 
I should never know that I have a thousand choices of mug to drink from because I need just one. 
Our propensity to favor the things that we choose means that its my favorite one. 
I cannot be distracted about an item that is absent from my space if I do not know that it exists at all. 
The obligation becomes so regular that we completely lose awareness. We lose perspective
about what happiness might truly mean, because it's usually much simpler and abstract
than the web of a lifestyle that we aspire to own. 
We don't consciously decide that it's an appropriate time to make a choice from a selection, 
but rather the selection presents itself and we feel obligated to make a choice. 
Like an expanding gas, we are pushed toward the purchase of larger, bigger and better things, and we must fill them with more. 
 I do not want more. I want to get away from it, to have fewer things, and more quiet. 
To dive deeper into niches of comfort and complexity that write these passions felt.
This comes from my heart after a trip to two cities. I did not find romance or adventure, 
excitement or joy. Just "More."

# More

We pay large amounts of money to ship our things across distance and sky. 
Why ride in economy when you can first class fly? Why have one dress when you can have two? 
Why choose between red when you can also have blue? You gave souvenirs and hors d'oeuvre, but my wedding 
is both quainter and richer than yours. I'll one up you with the size of my shed, 
with hand sawn trim and eclectic tread. Why remember where there are forests when we can build parks!
Your children will thrive with towering slides and big plastic sharks.
Now impress me big park, are you groomed to the max? I do hope you come with 
environmentally friendly bike racks! You won't use them, because you are busy shuffling to work? 
Pile into the sardine train, and sit next to that rich, mean jerk. 
You are happy with the two hour commute, is that how long it takes to drive? 
Wash it all away with beer after five. Tangled in the forest of dollars by season,
there is little light to be found here but only darkness and treason.

Sorry, I think I might have delved into politically incorrect. Perhaps instead
my new haircut you might inspect? But now I don't mean to boast, but have 
you tasted this artisinal toast? Don't walk too fast, you might perspire, 
as you stroll through this shopping empire! Leave your dollars here, don't 
ask where they go. To the creation of greed and sloth, this you choose to not know. 

I am disgusted, revolted, grimacing and hazed, running and escaping this prison for days. 
The hot smell of trash, the earth dead and concrete trying to trick me with a shiny green plastic treat. 

The urgency of a purchase, you think such a deal. Your insatiable hunger your gold coffin seal.
Surrounded by my own kind, but I feel so alone. I forever want only, I want nothing, but to simply go home.
