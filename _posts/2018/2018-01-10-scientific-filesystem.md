The Scientific Filesystem (scif) is an organizational format that supports exposure of executables and metadata for discoverability. The format includes a known filesystem structure, a definition for a set of environment variables describing it, and functions for generation of the variables and interaction with the libraries, metadata, and executables located within.


Here we show that interaction with a scientific filesystem is the same for a Docker image [vanessa/scif](https://hub.docker.com/r/vanessa/scif/) and a Singularity image, [scif-cli](https://singularity-hub.org/collections/424). They are generated from a [recipe](https://github.com/vsoch/scif/blob/master/docs/tutorials/hello-world.scif)
