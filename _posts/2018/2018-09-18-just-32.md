Today is my last night of thirty one<br>
Another year past, pooped, and done<br>
To you California I said goodbye,<br>
With some joy, and some heavy sigh<br>
To you North Carolina, I said hello!<br>
And oh the places we did go!<br>
From farmy mountain to woodsy ride<br>
To that infamous 7-11 Durham bridge<br>
I met my parents as people, for the first time<br>
They gave me their attention, their time<br>
I am ornery, critical, stubborn, and shrude<br>
My manner repetitive, my social skill crude<br>
I cannot claim to be sweet, soft, or kind<br>
But I can enter a fight with distance or mind.<br>
Tomorrow is my first day of thirty two<br>
why not start with a different kind of blue?<br>
