Her spirit was in those puzzles, <br>
Detailed, messy, twisty, and complex,  <br>
and in the process of making them,  <br>
A splatter of color on the dining room table <br>
from which emerged something of beauty. <br>
They melded into the other components that made up her routine,  <br>
a laptop covered in vegetables with worn out keys,  <br>
and a cocoa mug that remained with a history of brief cocoas past. <br><br>
When she had to pick up her things and move them away  <br>
When she was told the things were not welcome or accepted as they were,  <br>
It was a realization that she didn't fit within that artificial scene  <br>
Her comforts were piles of socks on the floor  <br>
and a blanket to sit on beneath an evening light  <br>
She realized that her only choice was suppression of herself  <br>
in favor of maintaining a controlled image of perfection <br>
She had tried that before, and it was suffocating <br>
She realized that her newfound safety had been an illusion  <br>
and more of a temporary sacrifice that was not wanted.  <br>
It was a differing of values that she might try to understand,  <br>
but like a puzzle piece dropped in the wrong box, <br>
she simply did not fit.  <br> <br>
Her spirit was in those puzzles,  <br>
and she had to protect it <br>
Her spirit was in those puzzles,  <br>
and as she packed them away,  <br>
she removed herself too.  <br>
