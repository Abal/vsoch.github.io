At the end of the summer I decided to try helping out with some teaching, and
so I decided to make...

<br>
<div style="text-align:center; font-size:26px; color: purple">A Dinosaur Lesson!</div>
<br>

I had to be creative, because along with being far away, I'm far from an expert. First,
I needed to fashion myself a "recording studio," consisting of a shoebox, an old iphone,
my faithful SRCC robot, and one of the two tables in my apartment that happens to be
my Mom's old art table (yes, that's paint on it, and no, it doesn't come off, and yes
I'm irrationally attached to it):

<div>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/dinosaur-lessons/studio.jpg" width="70%" style="padding-top:20px; padding-bottom:20px">
</div>

I found some good (free) editing and recording software (<a href="https://kdenlive.org/en/" target="_blank">kdenlive</a>
and the <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">Open Broadcaster Software</a>) to do it, and then jumped right in!
The lesson features the <a href="https://www.cognitiveatlas.org" target="_blank">Cognitive Atlas</a>, 
<a href="http://www.neurosynth.org" target="_blank">NeuroSynth</a>, and a little love for
his brethren <a href="https://www.neurovault.org" target="_blank">NeuroVault</a>, all tools that captured me
even before graduate school, and are *still* near and dear to my heart. 
For those that don't like videos, there is a <a href="https://github.com/vsoch/dinosaur-lessons/blob/master/neuro/notebook/cognitive-atlas-intro.ipynb" target="_blank">
jupyter notebook</a> to get you started with the <a href="https://github.com/CognitiveAtlas/cogat-python" target="_blank">API</a>. 
It's geared at a very introductory level to address:

<ol class="custom-counter">
<li>What are these tools?</li>
<li>Why would I want to use them?</li>
<li>How do I get started learning?</li>
</ol>

I had so much fun! I hope you enjoy this dinosaur lesson.
