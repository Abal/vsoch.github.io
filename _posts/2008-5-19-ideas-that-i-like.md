Ideas aren’t so rare anymore, and information is overly abundant. It isn’t knowledge that I crave, that I find impressive, but rather how a person thinks about this knowledge, sifts and spins it in multiple directions to show it to me in a beautiful, unbelievable way.

What does the world need?€ isn’t the question to ask

Pursue what makes you happy, and electrifies you

Because when I am electrified I feel alive

And the world needs people who are alive.

It is usually when we don’t fit it that we are forced to think about how the world works.

Experience is what you get when you don’t get what you wanted.

The most solid advice that I’ve ever received, from the only person I’ve ever seen as a role model, pertained to three qualities that make a good person. Humility, never giving in to complacency, and knowing that the only thing that is certain is that I, you, we, don’t know very much at all.

and on that note, I have huge respect for those who don’t take themselves too seriously. I think that brilliance isn’t in the achievements you impress upon others, the number of facts that you know perfectly, or the goals that you value, but in the way that you think, and your openness to people that might think differently than you do.
