nothing could reveal quite as much abut his flaws,  
 than the box of five hundred straws

grab one to drink his water with ice,  
 and a stirrer for dissolving protein was also quite nice  
 the marginal cost of two  
 because there are countless others in view!  
 why should he worry about three?  
 when there are still hundreds of others to see!  
 but perhaps he will stop at four  
 because removing the wrapping is quite a chore  
 the upper limit is most definitely five  
 when there are still five times that alive  
 because to purchase such a thing anew,  
 was quite an easy thing to do.

whittle away in impress it did  
 as there were no barriers placed on its lid

akin to pulling just a little on a magic string  
 to decide what season to actually bring  
 when under the warm blanket of snow  
 he pulled a little for the promise of spring glow  
 when the buds were not quickly enough seen  
 a deliberate touch would make it green  
 and of course excitement of summer days  
 would end with his sweat beads of haze  
 because he was sure that the fall  
 truly had the wantings of it all  
 and so the seasons would high and low  
 never a friend, always a foe.

he could not realize what he had done  
 until in his box there was only one  
 no more freedom to choose and date  
 this one left was his final fate  
 and so a deafening sadness he felt  
 to be playing the cards himself had dealt  
 but his despair was replaced with glee  
 a simple and clever solution, he could finally see  
 his ruthless consumption no longer a blur  
 his straw usage a well-defined, act of stir

you see, dear reader, the box never really was sparse  
 because insight to this future he could parse  
 it was when quite a plenty was left  
 that he saw his wasteful use as theft  
 each straw was not a faceless thing  
 but a promise of much happiness that it could bring!  
 if he took proper care of each of the bunch  
 he might never run out, was this clever hunch  
 and so life continued in this way  
 devotion to his straws he did not stray  
 and outlive the straws his time, he did  
 without the need for top, restraint, or lid

nothing could reveal quite as much abut his flaws,  
 than the box of five hundred straws  
 but nothing could reveal quite as much about his soul  
 when living for each moment became his goal
