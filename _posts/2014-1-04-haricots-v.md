A moment of awareness, overwhelming for a small pea  
 an ephemeral glimpse of what it might be like, to be.  
 The world is so harsh for one that is so small.  
 The world is too busy to listen for your call.  
 Many miss you, your gentle nature they fail to see.  
 But Iâ€™ll never miss you, you are special to me, my Haricots V.
