Twas the day before Mom came, and all through the house,<br>
The windows begged to be cleaned, the sink properly doused.<br>
Vanessa's sneakers sat by the door with care,<br>
Left beside right, because feet do not share.<br>

The ice cubes were nestled all snug in their trays,<br>
Ready to give Mom icy cold drinks for days<br>
The bike out with girl, and I parked far away,<br>
to have my own parking spot, I dreamed of the day.<br>

When far on Cal Ave, there arose such a clatter,<br>
the cars all flashed their lights to see what was the matter.<br>
Down to the corner I creeped like a bug<br>
careful to not disturb dasboard, tiny car rug.<br>

The bikes coming fast on the freshly paved ground,<br>
Anointed the air with a spinning wheel sound.<br>
When, they passed, my eyes could not obstain<br>
gazing on the newly arrived Caltrain!<br>

Out hopped a funny lady, with small bones and palm, <br>
I knew in a moment, why it must be Mom!<br>
More swiftly than gazelle, she pulled out her phone.<br>
and started navigation to Vanessa's home.<br>

Now Siri, Now Siri,<br>
Left turn, and stop!<br>
Now Siri? Now Siri?<br>
On Cal Ave! On shop!<br>
To the end of the way! <br>
To the top of the day!<br>
Onward to this mall<br>
Now walk away, walk away,<br>
Walk away all!<br>

As the suitcases that wheel as their owners do fly,<br>
charging down the sidewalk they went, not even shy<br>
so toward the house with a mission they flew<br>
to deliver the touch of the Mom hand, they would do.<br>

And then in the key hole, I heard a small click<br>
And opened the door without even a stick!<br>
As I peeked a bit closer to look in the crack,<br>
Mom opened the fridge toward her avocado snack!<br>

She was dressed in all purple, from head to her toe<br>
covered in paint, as an artist would know.<br>
A bundle of things she brought in her purse,<br>
ready for any hurricane, spell, or curse.<br>

Her eyes, a greenish hue that looked up and down,<br>
her cute Mommy self, so huggably round!<br>
Her poofed little hair was squashed by a hat,<br>
Her chest enormous, compared to Vanessa so flat<br>
A high powered laptop she held in her clutch,<br>
for World of Warcraft, internet browsing, and such.<br>
Her Mary Jane shoesies were purple and snug<br>
carrying the all powerful, the all healing, Mommy hug.<br>

She was perfectly Vanessa, some things to a T!<br>
I laughed a bit, and out slipped an oil pee.<br>
A smile turned her lips and a quick start to work<br>
I knew that I need not worry or lurk.<br>

She had a licorice candy, and flew around the place.<br>
Not a hairball, or pillow to find out of place.<br>
And finished her blessing, she turned like a top<br>
And walked straight out, to the nearest coffee shop.<br>

Cafe Bustelo, she asked for distinctly.<br>
And a mediocre latte she was given succinctly.<br>
But I heard her exclaim, as she left with a strut,<br>
"Now is time to find, Vanessa turkey butt!"<br>
