Oh, hey. <br>
-Yo.<br>
Are you Joe?<br>
-I am Joe<br>
Joe...<br>
-Joe.<br>
Shmoe.<br>
-No, just Joe.<br>

Joe.<br>
-Yeah?<br>
Wanna go?<br>
-I don't know.<br>
-Is there snow?<br>
If we go...<br>
-Still don't know.<br>
Although...<br>
-A show?<br>
Oh yeah, bro.<br>
Like cello?<br>
But you'll need dough.<br>
-I prefer pho.<br>
-Sometimes roe.<br>
Here or to go?<br>
-Just the pho.<br>
Quid pro quo?<br>
-Roe for pho?<br>
Pho for roe.<br>
-Oh.<br>
-Probably no.<br>

Hey Joe.<br>
-Yo.<br>
Do you like to sew?<br>
-Only if I got dough.<br>
Oh, so you want to go?<br>
-High or low?<br>
High. Like whoa.<br>
-How do you know?<br>
Looks like a Van Gogh.<br>
-Oh, whoa.<br>
-Like colorful flow?<br>
A purple toe...<br>
Swirling glow!<br>
-Apollo!<br>
That's Michaelangelo...<br>
-Oh.<br>
-Is he friend or foe?<br>
Real, bro.<br>
-Then you mean faux.<br>
Oh.<br>
Definitely amigo.<br>

Hey Joe.<br>
Still don't know?<br>
-This computer is slow.<br>
I totally know.<br>
Behold and lo...<br>
-Exception throw!<br>
Did you commit, though?<br>
-Not really, no.<br>
Then pull, bro.<br>
-I know, I know.<br>
*piss and moan*<br>
-Doh!<br>
Why the show?<br>
-Stack overflow!<br>
Pancakes are so-so.<br>
-Maple syrup, I bestow!<br>
Tree farts, in tow!<br>
-Hey I gotta fix this repo.<br>
See you tomorrow?<br>
-Yeah, I gotta go.<br>

-Hey, bro.<br>
-So so...<br>
-Do YOU wanna go?<br>
Who should we ask? I wouldn't know.<br>
-Maybe that crow?<br>
Edgar Allen Po!<br>
-That's a raven, bro.<br>
I prefer Henry David Thoreau<br>
-"Who could not with his beams e'er melt me so"<br>
Wow, super pro!<br>
-I know :)<br>
He wrote that ages ago...<br>
-Should have used accasciato...<br>
I don't follow?<br>
-Melts better, you know.<br>
OH.<br>
-Oh?<br>
Henry!! Nomnom... No?<br>
-No. I already said, I like pho.<br>
I know, I know.<br>

-Hello?<br>
Hey, Joe.<br>
-I feel sorrow.<br>
How so?<br>
-Kinda hollow.<br>
An emotional blow?<br>
-Dunno<br>
Like ten to zero?<br>
-Yeah I think so.<br>
Oh.<br>
-I gotta follow.<br>
That's a good motto.<br>
-No, it's heart bro.<br>
We'll miss you, you know.<br>
-Yeah, it's time to go.<br>
Where to, Joe?<br>
-Grad school, ho!<br>
-You wanna go?<br>
Like yesterday's fro!<br>
-Let's go!<br>
Thought ya'd never say so :)<br>
