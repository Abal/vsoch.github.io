Before the light of this evening  
Into a memory does wane  
I would like to share a sentiment  
for Brother and Jane

The nostalgia within us all  
on this fifth of September  
is not entirely in this moment  
but in the things we remember

We step in and out of ourselves  
Like an old pair of shoes  
And the biggest insight to life may be  
that our happiness we do so chose

When Brother was small  
A curly haired Matthew  
Not much taller than a hip  
and I called him Cashew

With imagination we built  
tiny ships out of paper  
he had a slight head tilt  
he was rice and cheese caper

We lived in our heads  
and that made adolesence hard  
Brother receded into himself  
put up an emotional guard

It was ten years later  
during college at UMASS  
when he grew into himself  
and I realized this time had passed

And then he went to Spain  
and interpret how you will this sign  
Brother became a debonnaire  
and developed a taste for red wine

And during his time in med school  
a memory not mine but true  
Brother laid eyes on the lovely Jane  
and thought, "I choose you."

And such happiness in my heart  
to see this love unfold  
such joy in my family  
for this story to be told

And it is not something to fear  
to grow up and old  
because destiny is not decided  
But rather foretold

I love you so much,  
From fire start to fading embre  
Remember, remember, the fifth of September
