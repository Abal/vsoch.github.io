I have a thing for dimensionality reduction.  One method in particular, the Self organizing map, is probably my favorite.  I made this tutorial for my lab, but I thought it would be useful to share with the world of the internet! Click on the presentation, and then use your cursor to move through the slides.  [Here you can also see](http://vbmis.com/bmi/diabolical/SOM.html) the presentation in a new window, or [download a PDF](http://www.vbmis.com/bmi/diabolical/TheSelfOrganizingMap.pdf). <iframe class="iframe-class" frameborder="0" height="650" scrolling="yes" src="http://vbmis.com/bmi/diabolical/SOM.html" width="100%"></iframe>
