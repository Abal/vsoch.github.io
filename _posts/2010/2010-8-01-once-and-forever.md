Vibrance and rapture, epiphany and sound  
 Gummy and splendor, elegance and bound  
 Constant in motion, mind in a whirl  
 Responsibility of a woman, heart of a girl

Glowing the night lamp, hard fall the eyes  
 Gentacular hum of the heater subside  
 Blanket the darkness, creep out the mind  
 Uncover that which to day is blind

Enveloped by passion, research abound  
 No chance to pause, no heart to be found

But near draw the night, a moment of clear  
 Escape from the heart a memory so dear  
 Four years past, sunshine and snow  
 Imprinted in memory, a face does not go

Quiet in weakness, imprinted by heart  
 Destined to find, and be jostled apart  
 A chance of a voice, a hint of a scent  
 Painful to suppress that which is meant

Never again, vows before dream  
 Comfort in one, spot, bed, and seam  
 Anew springs the day, no time to feel  
 Covered up gently, this Achilles heel

Stronger to face, resilient to go  
 Naive to unwilling, I never shall know  
 Sunsets in play, day night and sky  
 That which is strong wrenching to cry

Burgeon my senses, mind, soul and heart  
 loving you forever, though forever apart
