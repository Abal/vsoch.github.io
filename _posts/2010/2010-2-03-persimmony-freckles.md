Persimmony freckles  
 That’s who you are  
 Gooseberry speckles  
 Cutely bizarre

Mountains of dusk  
 Thats what you see  
 Tantifying orchards  
 Bug snow and pea

Glorious frazzle  
 Thats what you fear  
 Soft velvet tassle  
 Precious and dear

Marigold angles,  
 That’s how you think  
 Silver dipped dangles  
 Embellished by pink

Persimmony freckles  
 That’s who you are  
 Elusive those speckles  
 Wherever you are.
