Once, there was a little scripty  
 Who fell in love with a 3D nifti  
 His demeanor, discreet  
 He processed him with FEAT  
 and showcased the output with glee

Alas, there was no carpe diem  
 All was revealed through SPM  
 His beloved was paired with a .hdr  
 who, by default, fit him much better  
 and scripty’s shell was ripped open

Bashful and broken is he  
 No longer to run on the queue,  
 A lonely, outdated piece of code  
 he remains uncompiled on the head node  
 infinitely echoing “poor little old me!”

After months of cold shoulders  
 A python script entered his folder  
 All was clear with a submit  
 the two would make quite a fit!  
 to process significant BOLD

This concludes our tale  
 Of the little scripty who did prevail  
 The two found love and behold!  
 They made many iterations on the head node

:O)
