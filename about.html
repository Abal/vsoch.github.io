<p style="padding-top:40px">I am a <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/vanessa-sochat" target="_blank">Research Software Engineer</a> for <a href="https://srcc.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Research Computing</a> at Stanford University. I specialize in system engineering, infrastructure development, and scientific computational analyses and workflows. While my <a href="http://bmi.stanford.edu" target="_blank">graduate training</a> is in image processing and neuroinformatics, my current interest and obsession is building tools at the intersection of cloud, container, and HPC technologies. I am the primary developer at Stanford for <a href="https://singularityware.github.io" target="_blank">Singularity</a>, and lead developer of <a href="https://singularity-hub.org" target="_blank">Singularity Hub</a>, a framework optimized for deployment of container-based workflows and "science as a service" capabilities. For Stanford my primary goal is provide support for <a href="https://researchapps.github.io/" target="_blank">Research Applications</a>. I am an advocate for open source development and Linux. My work is challenging, fun, and I only wish I had more hours in the day to build the things that I dream of. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}rawr">Rawr</a> the Vanessasaurus!</p>

<p>As a graduate student my work spanned computer science, medicine, and imaging. I was a proud member of the <a href="http://poldracklab.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Poldrack Lab</a> at Stanford. Our work spanned neuro-informatics, cognitive neuroscience, and reproducibility. I was introduced to the domain of neuroimaging as an RA in the <a href="http://www.haririlab.com" target="_blank">Laboratory of Neurogenetics</a> at Duke University working under Ahmad Hariri.</p>

<p>The qualities of experience that are most fulfilling to me are making things work, organizing and understanding new processes, and creating efficiency and beauty in design. I love learning, programming and debugging, and I have vision for how I want the future to be. I am adamant about pursuing the things that make me happy, today and now. A successful life means confidence in a future vision and happiness in the present.</p>

<p>While this is primarily a personal site, most of my life can be found on <a href="http://www.github.com/vsoch" target="_blank">[github]</a>, current exploration is under <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}rawr">[rawr]</a>, and a general list of work under <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}work">[portfolio]</a>. During graduate school I maintained a space for exploration of methods and dataÂ <a href="http://www.vbmis.com/learn" target="_blank">[1]</a>, as well as pre-graduate school documentation and work <a href="http://www.vsoch.com/wiki" target="_blank">[2]</a>.
