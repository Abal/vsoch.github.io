<p style="padding-top:40px">I am a <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/vanessa-sochat" target="_blank">Research Software Engineer</a> for <a href="https://srcc.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford Research Computing</a> and the <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford School of Medicine</a>. I specialize in system engineering, infrastructure development, and <a href="http://langlotzlab.stanford.edu" target="_blank">image and natural language processing</a> for scientific computational analyses and workflows. I am the primary developer at Stanford for <a href="https://singularityware.github.io" target="_blank">Singularity</a>, a driver to bring <a href="https://researchapps.github.io/" target="_blank">Research Applications</a> support to Stanford, and lead developer of <a href="http://www.singularity-hub.org" target="_blank">Singularity Hub</a>, a framework optimized for deployment of container-based workflows and "science as a service" capabilities.</p>

<p>My passion lies in building applications that leverage machine learning to solve challenging problems, providing users with novel tools for visualizing their results, and offering robust mechanisms for reproducing and sharing their analyses. My core interests tend to be focused around high performance computing and modern web technology, and my preference is for open source development and Linux. My work is challenging, fun, and I only wish I had more hours in the day to build the things that I dream of. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}rawr">rawwwr the Vanessasaurus!</a></p>

<p>As a graduate student my work spanned computer science, medicine, and imaging. I was a proud member of the <a href="http://poldracklab.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Poldrack Lab</a> at Stanford. Our work spanned neuro-informatics, cognitive neuroscience, and reproducibility. I was introduced to the domain of neuroimaging as an RA in the <a href="http://www.haririlab.com" target="_blank">Laboratory of Neurogenetics</a> at Duke University working under Ahmad Hariri. We utilized functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), as well as behavioral and genetic data to study how variability in neural circuitry can lead to individual differences in behavior, and how these differences in brain function can further be connected to an individual's genes. I am forever grateful to Ahmad for introducing me to the work that I've come to love.</p>

<p>The qualities of experience that are most fulfilling to me are making things work, organizing and understanding new processes, and creating efficiency and beauty in design. I love learning, coding and debugging, and all parts of research. I am adamant about pursuing the things that make me happy, today and now. A successful life means confidence in a future vision and happiness in the present.</p>

<p>While this is primarily a personal site, I maintain separate spaces for current exploration of methods and data <a href="http://www.vbmis.com/learn" target="_blank">[1]</a>, and pre-graduate school documentation and work <a href="http://www.vsoch.com/wiki" target="_blank">[2]</a>, and most of my life can be found on <a href="http://www.github.com/vsoch" target="_blank">[github]</a>, and what I do for fun <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}work">[portfolio]</a>. Contact information and is available upon request.</p>
